# Clustering - World Happiness Report 2021

- The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country.

- Based on the World happiness report of 2021, clusters are being created depending upon the scores these countries got for various parameters. The purpose is to understand which countries are most similar when seen in terms of these parameters.

I have tried to form the clusters using both Hierarchical and KMeans clustering.

The data and description is taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021

### Further study:
- Countries falling in same clusters can be studied together to understand the relation between them in terms of all the features and then future social policies could be made accordingly to improve upon the factors.
- Countries with lower scores can study the factors from the cluster contraining countries with higher scores to gain insights about their current policies

#### Note:
The four images attached are the images at different angles of the 3d KMeans clusters formed. For some reason, the 3-d cluster plot is not appearing in the python file. Neverthless, I have attached the images separately to view 3 clusters formed using Kmeans.
